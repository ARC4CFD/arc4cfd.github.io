Summary of all currently available styles/features. It should be noted that there is plenty of stuff that can be added as necessary, but for now this is plenty and I'm trying to keep things relatively simple as I don't 
really know CSS or JavaScript.

## Theme
To modify the theme colours, use the editor [here](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#theming).

## Blocks

:::note['Note' Style Block]
This is the 'note' style block.
:::

:::tip['Tip' Style Block]
This is the 'tip' style block.
:::

:::caution['Caution' Style Block]
This is the 'caution' style block.
:::

:::danger['Danger' Style Block]

## Code

There are a ton of options for code blocks. You have your basic code block (no syntax highlighting):
```
Hello world!
```
You have bash code blocks, which include syntax highlighting for bash commands and includes a pretty frame:
```bash
cd $SCRATCH
ls -la
```
You can add a title to this frame:
```bash title="Going to scratch..."
cd $SCRATCH
ls -la
```
You can alse remove the frame and keep only the syntax highlighting if that's preferable (it will do this automatically if you use comments). Without the frame, however, you can't title this code block:
```bash frame="none"
cd $SCRATCH
ls -la
```
Similarly, syntax highlighting is supported for proper programming languages as well:
```python
# The world's simplest Python script
x = 'Hello World!'
print(x)
```
A title can also be added to these non-bash code blocks (for example, with the name of the file):
```python title="helloworld.py"
# The world's simplest Python script
x = 'Hello World!'
print(x)
```

### Highlighting
Elements in code blocks can be highlighted to emphasize certain areas. You can mark whole lines:
```python {2-4}
def iseven(x):
    if not x%2:
        return True
    return False

print(iseven(4))
```
These lines can be coloured green or red (inserted or deleted):
```python {1} ins={6-7} del={2}
def iseven(x):
    print("Delete me")
    if not x%2:
        return True
    return False

print(iseven(4))
```
You can also highlight particular pieces of text using exact matching expressions or RegEx:
```python "even" /return.*/
def iseven(x):
    if not x%2:
        return True
    return False

print(iseven(4))
```
Just as with lines, you can colour your highlighting of words either green or red (inserted or deleted):
```python "even" ins=/return.*/ del="print("Delete me")"
def iseven(x):
    print("Delete me")
    if not x%2:
        return True
    return False

print(iseven(4))
```

## Expanding Sections
<details>
    <summary>Example 1</summary>
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    # Do other things
    ```
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Example 2</summary>
    Example 2 content
</details>

:::note
In a block:
<details>
    <summary>Example in Block</summary>
    I'm in a block!
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
</details>

## Expanded (.mdx) Capabilities
Extended capabilities requiring use of an extended markdown file `.mdx`. Components are specified in the `src/components` folder and must be imported at the top of the document in order to be used.

### Tab Groups
<Tabs group="tab-group">
    <TabItem label="Tab 1">
        Contents of tab 1
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Tab 2">
        Contents of tab 2
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Tab 3">
        Contents of tab 3
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Custom Blocks
In order to create a block with an alternate colour/icon, use the `CustomAside` HTML tag. All supported icons can be found [here](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/#icon). Colour options are:
- `blue`
- `yellow`
- `red`
- `green`
- `bw` (black on light theme, white on dark theme)

<CustomAside icon="star" title="Custom Block 1" colour="green">I am a custom block!</CustomAside>
<CustomAside icon="pen" title="Custom Block 2" colour="bw">So am I!</CustomAside>

### Enclosing Box
A coloured box can be generated in which other components may be placed. At the moment it is limited to purple, but if desired I can expand it to include any of the other colour schemes as seen for the custom blocks.
<Box>
This is a box in which other components can be placed (for example, a multiple choice block as seen below)
</Box>
You can also add an image to the top right hand side!
<Box imgSrc="/src/assets/mpilab.png">
This box has an image. You can use any image by giving a path to the image (should be stored in the `assets` folder just for consistency). It has now been fixed so that the text will wrap around the image.
</Box>
If you want the image color to adapt (ideal case), use a custom svg icon instead! To create your own, add the svg code to the `CustomIcon.ts` file with a suitable identifier (or just ask me), and then that identifier can be given to the `Box` object to fetch the image:
<Box iconName="quiz">
This is the **QUIZ** box. 
</Box>
<Box iconName="exercise">
This is the **EXAMPLE** box. 
</Box>
Similar to custom blocks, the color can be changed. THe default color is purple, all options are:
- `blue`
- `purple`
- `yellow`
- `red`
- `green`
- `bw` (black on light theme, white on dark theme)
- `clear` (only border)
<Box color='clear' iconName='exercise'>
This is a clear box
</Box>
<Box color='green' iconName='exercise'>
This is a green box
</Box>
<Box color='blue' iconName='exercise'>
This is a blue box
</Box>
<Box color='yellow' iconName='exercise'>
This is a yellow box
</Box>
<Box color='red' iconName='exercise'>
This is a red box
</Box>
<Box color='bw' iconName='exercise'>
This is a bw box
</Box>

When placed in a block, the clear box should adapt to the blocks colouring:
<CustomAside icon="star" title="Block with Clear Box" colour="green">
<Box color='clear' iconName='exercise'>
This is a clear box
</Box>
</CustomAside>

### Multiple Choice
<MultipleChoice>
    <Option>
        Option 1
    </Option>
    <Option isCorrect>
        Option 2
    </Option>
    <Option>
        Option 3
    </Option>
</MultipleChoice>

### Spoilers
Use the `<Spoiler>` HTML tag to <Spoiler>hide text until the user clicks it</Spoiler>

### Fetch Remote Code
You can retrieve code from some online url and place it in your page using the `<CodeFetch />` tag. For example, fetching `isleap.py` from the `dev` branch of the arc4cfd repo:

<CodeFetch rawURL='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARC4CFD/arc4cfd/dev/section1/isleap.py' lang='python' meta="title='isleap.py'" />

You can get the url to the raw code hosted on a github repository by clicking on the 'raw' button when viewing the code on github and copying the url of the window that opens.

All code options outlined [above](#code) can be included by adding them to the string in the `meta` property of the tag. For example:
<CodeFetch rawURL='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARC4CFD/arc4cfd/dev/section1/isleap.py' lang='python' meta="title='isleap.py' ins={4,5} mark={7} del={9-15}" />

Moving forward it's probably better to only fetch code from the master branch, but this was just as a demonstration.

### YouTube Videos
You can embed YouTube videos!

<YouTube id='5zI9sG3pjVU' />

You can also set specific start/stop points and other options:

<YouTube id='5zI9sG3pjVU' params='start=30&end=40&rel=0'/>

See [YouTube's documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#Parameters) for parameters that can be passed.

### Gifs
While you can include gifs in regular markdown using the image syntax, they don't always resize properly. To fix this, I've created a `<Gif />` component:

<Gif src='/src/assets/figs_section2/IsoTurb2D.gif' width='100%' alt='' />
