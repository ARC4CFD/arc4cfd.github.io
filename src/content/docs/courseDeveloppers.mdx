#### Dr. Francesco Ambrogi


#### Dr. Jean-Pierre Hickey
Dr. Hickey is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo, Canada. Dr. Hickey leads the Multi-Physics Interaction Lab and is drawn to the study of complex fluid problems in aerospace involving the strong coupling between thermodynamics, acoustics, chemical kinetics, and, invariably, turbulence. 
   Prior to joining Waterloo in 2016, Dr. Hickey was a Research Scientist at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Göttingen and a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Turbulence Research at Stanford University. He received his Ph.D. from the Royal Military College of Canada, his M.Sc. from the Darmstadt University of Technology, and his bachelor from École Polytechnique de Montreal. He held visiting Professorship (2024) at the EM2C Lab in CentraleSupelec as part of the Université Paris-Saclay.
