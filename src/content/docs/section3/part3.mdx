data lifecycle.

Data collection: type of data, naming convention, etc.
Documentation: how to read
Saving data
data archival





Requirements: DMP, provide information to validate the results, deport data in data repository, open up data


Content of data management plans (DMPs) are built around the particular needs of each project



The following are a set of guideline puts forth by Science Europe [‘Practical Guide to the International Alignment of Research Data Management’](https://scienceeurope.org/media/4brkxxe5/se_rdm_practical_guide_extended_final.pdf)

1. Data description and collection or re-use of existing data
- How will new data be collected or produced and/or how will existing data be re-used?
- What data (for example the kinds, formats, and volumes) will be collected or produced?
2. Documentation and data quality
- What metadata and documentation (for example the methodology of data collection and way of organising data) will accompany data?
- What data quality control measures will be used?
3. Storage and backup during the research process
- How will data and metadata be stored and backed up during the research process?
- How will data security and protection of sensitive data be taken care of during the research?
4. Legal and ethical requirements, codes of conduct
- If personal data are processed, how will compliance with legislation on personal data and on data security be ensured?
- How will other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, be managed? What legislation is applicable?
- How will possible ethical issues be taken into account, and codes of conduct followed?
5. Data sharing and long-term preservation
- How and when will data be shared? Are there possible restrictions to data sharing or embargo reasons?
- How will data for preservation be selected, and where will data be preserved long-term (for example a data repository or archive)?
- What methods or software tools will be needed to access and use the data?
- How will the application of a unique and persistent identifier (such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)) to each data set be ensured?
6. Data management responsibilities and resources
- Who (for example role, position, and institution) will be responsible for data management (i.e. the data steward)?
- What resources (for example financial and time) will be dedicated to data management and ensuring that data will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable)?
