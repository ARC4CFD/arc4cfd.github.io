This class introduces the concepts of Research Data Management and applies these concepts to the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics. 


## Underlying principle of research data management
Research data management (RDM) is concerned with the management of the entire lifecycle of data used or generated as part of a research project. RDM seeks to develop best practices to organize, structure, share, store and care for the scientific data. RDM stem from the understanding that 'publicly funded research data are a public good'   re ohmann_sharing_2017.  Therefore, RDM seeks to maximize the  value of research data for the greatest societal benefit. It should be noted that good data management is not a goal in itself  ref wilkinson_fair_2016 but a means to better value the research data.


The field of RDM has emerged primarily from the need to manage sensitive (medical data) and/or expensive datasets (astrophysics) and driven by large-scale research endeavours. RDM has also developed parallel to the increasing push towards transparent and open science, which is further motivating the need for curated data. 

Within this context, the understanding of RDM principles is not as well developed within the CFD community. This is in part due to the nature of CFD workflows which is typically better suited for individual researchers or small research groups as opposed to large-research enterprise (such as in bio-informatics or astrophysics). 

Yet, the use of high performance computing with modern CFD tools generates lots of expensive dataset that are not fully valorized without modern RDM practices. We do note the following repositories:
