Computational fluid dynamics remains unique among many modern disciplines relying on HPC. The constitutive equations are derived from classical Newtonian physics and can be written down as a system of partial differential equations. Yet, the there is no generalizeable closed form solution, especially in turbulent flow. This is especially problematic given the multi-scale nature of turbulence. Modern efforts, especially for scale resolving simulations, are pushing 
High fidelity data must be generated, yet it is not apriori clear what data is relevant to understanding the problem.


    
 
    
## What to deposit
Everything needed to FIND, ASSESS, UNDERSTAND, 'REPRODUCE', and REUSE.

DATA, METADATA ('data about data'), ANY other documentation

## Do we need to store all data?
Data generated from Computational Fluid Dynamics is inherently deterministic. In other words, given the identical initial state and boundary conditions of a problem, abstracted from numerical and round-off errors, we should be able to reproduce the same dataset. As a field that draws its heritage from Newtonian physics, the challenges in CFD are different from experimental fluid mechanics and other which have big-data challenges. 

Let's consider a modern case of turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau~5200$ [test](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/direct-numerical-simulation-of-turbulent-channel-flow-up-to-mathitreittauapprox-5200/3AE84A5A48F83AF294F6CB042AF92DA8)
This represents a 
Nx=10240, Ny=1024,  and  Nz=7680 = 80,530,636,800
