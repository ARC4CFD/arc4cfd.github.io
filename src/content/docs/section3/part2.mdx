## What to deposit
Everything needed to FIND, ASSESS, UNDERSTAND, 'REPRODUCE', and REUSE.

## Do we need to store all data?
Data generated from Computational Fluid Dynamics is inherently deterministic. In other words, given the identical initial state and boundary conditions of a problem, abstracted from numerical and round-off errors, we should be able to reproduce the same dataset. As a field that draws its heritage from Newtonian physics, the challenges in CFD are different from experimental fluid mechanics and other which have big-data challenges. 

Let's consider a modern case of turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau~5200$ [test](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/direct-numerical-simulation-of-turbulent-channel-flow-up-to-mathitreittauapprox-5200/3AE84A5A48F83AF294F6CB042AF92DA8)
This represents a 
Nx=10240, Ny=1024,  and  Nz=7680 = 80,530,636,800
