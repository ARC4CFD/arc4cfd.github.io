## Lead Course Developers

#### Dr. Francesco Ambrogi
Dr. [Francesco Ambrogi](https://francescoambrogi.github.io/) obtained his PhD from Queen’s University in December 2023 under the supervision of Prof. Ugo Piomelli. During his PhD, he worked as a graduate research assistant in the Turbulence Simulation and Modelling (TSM) laboratory, and as a teaching fellow in the Mechanical and Materials Engineering department where he taught Fluid Mechanics to second year engineering students. His research focuses on computational and theoretical studies of turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) with pressure gradients. Specifically, he is interested in simulating the effect of strong unsteady adverse and favorable pressure gradients on the physics of wall bounded flows. As of January 2024, Dr. Ambrogi is an adjunct faculty at Queen’s University where he teaches Fluid Mechanics, and at the Royal Military College of Canada where he teaches Advanced Fluid Mechanics. At the end of April 2024 Dr. Ambrogi will join the MPI Lab, led by Dr. Hickey, as a Postdoctoral researcher.

#### Dr. Jean-Pierre Hickey
Dr. [Jean-Pierre Hickey](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/profile/j6hickey) is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo, Canada. Dr. Hickey leads the Multi-Physics Interaction Lab and is drawn to the study of complex fluid problems in aerospace involving the strong coupling between thermodynamics, acoustics, chemical kinetics, and, invariably, turbulence. Prior to joining Waterloo in 2016, Dr. Hickey was a Research Scientist at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Göttingen and a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Turbulence Research at Stanford University. He received his Ph.D. from the Royal Military College of Canada, his M.Sc. from the Darmstadt University of Technology, and his bachelor from École Polytechnique de Montréal. He held Visiting Professorship (2024) at the EM2C Lab in CentraleSupelec as part of the Université Paris-Saclay.
