Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a field of computational physics that has a very high utilization of modern Advanced Research Computing (ARC) resources.  The spatial and temporal resolution required to solve CFD problems means well suited to take advantage of the full benefits of large-scale, parallelized high-performance computing on ARC infrastructure.    The field of CFD has a broad and diverse user base that transcends many of the classical boundaries in science and engineering. As CFD tools have progressed, their predictive capabilities and user-friendliness have improved, which means that they are increasingly being adopted by nontraditional users of high-performance computing (HPC) such as experimentalists, theoreticians, even student design teams. Advanced Research Computing for Computational Fluid Dynamics, or ARC4CFD, is developed to help learners with a cursory knowledge of fluid dynamics and CFD bridge the knowledge gap toward the effective usage of CFD on modern ARC resources. 


## Teaching philosophy
ARC4CFD is an asynchronous, online course available on at [https://arc4cfd.github.io](https://arc4cfd.github.io). The multimodal course content includes written text, videos, interactive quizzes, and hands-on examples covering a wide range of topics in ARC.   This course uses  an entirely open-source CFD toolchain from meshing all the way to solving, and visualization, in order to facilitate a broad usage.  The course is developed to:  1) emphasize the development of a systematic approach for the effective utilization of CFD usage on ARC systems,  2)  provide a high-level, theoretical understanding of the main concepts for using CFD on HPC, and 3)  provide hands-on examples for the learners to put into practice these concept.  The course is divided into three sections, which are made up of a number of classes each with clearly defined learning outcomes. These sections are structured in a way for the reader to first develop a foundational understanding of high-performance computing ([section 1](https://arc4cfd.github.io/section1)), translate those concepts to specific challenges in CFD and develop a systematic approach towards a CFD workflow ([section 2](https://arc4cfd.github.io/section2)), and then to effectively manage the research data throughout the entire workflow ([section 3](https://arc4cfd.github.io/section3)). 

## Target audience
The target audience for this course is:
- new graduate students in computational physics or engineering
- experimentalist and theoreticians complementing their work with numerical simulations on HPC
- undergraduate students on student design teams interested in leveraging CFD with HPC

## Learning outcomes
At the end of this course, the learner should be able to:
1- **Define the main concepts in parallel and high performance computing** 
2- **Conduct an a priori estimate of the computational cost of a CFD simulation**
3- **Explain the impact of modelling assumptions on HPC cost**
4- **Optimize simulation parameters of a CFD problem for HPC**
5- **Develop a research data management strategy for a CFD workflow**




The built around the end-user of the CFD tools. In other words, the focus lies in providing the end-user with the knowledge necessary to most effectively run these simulations on HPC system.  But in order to understand the effective usage of 



It's expected that the learners have a basic understanding of fluid dynamics and computational fluid dynamics as this course is designed to bridge the knowledge gap between basic CFD knowledge and the utilization of these tools on modern HPC systems. 


Advanced research computing (ARC) includes (but is not limited to) high performance computing, advanced computing, artificial intelligence, big data, visualization, storage, software, portals, and platforms involved with research at Canadian academic and research institutes.



This course was developed in the [Multi-Physics Interaction Lab](https://www.mpilab.ca) at the University of Waterloo, Canada with the financial support of Compute Ontario.
