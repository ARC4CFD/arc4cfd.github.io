Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a field of computational physics that has a very high utilization of modern Advanced Research Computing (ARC) resources.  The spatial and temporal resolution required to solve these problems makes CFD particularly well suited to take advantage of the full benefits of large-scale, parallelized high-performance computing on ARC infrastructure.  This course is designed to help students with a cursory knowledge of fluid dynamics and CFD to bridge the gap to effectively leverage modern ARC resources. 


## Teaching philosophy
ARC4CFD is an asynchronous online course to accompany the learner in developing skills to effectively utilize Advanced Research Computing for Computational Fluid Dynamics. This course is built around the usage of an entirely open-sourced toolset from meshing, solving, and visualization.  The course is developed to:  1) emphasize the development of a systematic approach for the effective utilization of CFD usage on ARC systems,  2)  provide a high-level, theoretical understanding of the main concepts for using CFD on HPC, and 3)  provide hands-on examples for the learners to put into practice these concept.  The course is divided into three sections, which are made up of a number of classes each with clearly defined learning outcomes. These structured in a way for the reader to first develop a foundational understanding of high-performance computing ([section 1](https://arc4cfd.github.io/section1)), translate those concepts to specific challenges in CFD ([section 2](https://arc4cfd.github.io/section2)), and then to effectively manage the resulting research data ([section 3](https://arc4cfd.github.io/section3)). The multimodal course content includes written content, videos, interactive quizzes, and hands-on examples covering various aspects of ARC.  

## Organization of the course
- [Section 1: Foundational Aspects of ARC](https://arc4cfd.github.io/section1/outline/)
- [Section 2: Leveraging HPC for large-scale CFD](https://arc4cfd.github.io/section2/outline/)
- [section 3: Research Data Management for CFD](https://arc4cfd.github.io/section3)

## Learning outcomes of the course
At the end of this course, the learner should be able to:
1. **Assess the parameters influencing computational cost and their modelling assumptions**
2. **Conduct an a priori estimate of the computational cost of a CFD simulation**
3. **Determine the most efficient workflow and strategies for CFD on HPC systems**
4. **Find the optimal parameters and settings to run a CFD simulation on HPC**


## Target audience
The target audience for this course is:
- new graduate students in computational physics or engineering
- experimentalist and theoreticians complementing their work with numerical simulations on HPC
- undergraduate students on student design teams interested in leveraging CFD with HPC

It's expected that the learners have a basic understanding of fluid dynamics and computational fluid dynamics as this course is designed to bridge the knowledge gap between basic CFD knowledge and the utilization of these tools on modern HPC systems. 


Advanced research computing (ARC) includes (but is not limited to) high performance computing, advanced computing, artificial intelligence, big data, visualization, storage, software, portals, and platforms involved with research at Canadian academic and research institutes.



This course was developed in the [Multi-Physics Interaction Lab](https://www.mpilab.ca) at the University of Waterloo, Canada with the financial support of Compute Ontario.
