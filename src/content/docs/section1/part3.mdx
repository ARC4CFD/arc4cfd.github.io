## Running a job on HPC 
There are two basic ways of accessing resources and running jobs on the cluster:
-  run  interactively jobs (supervised).
-  run non-interactive jobs (unsupervised).

Both approaches are investigated in the class. 


### Running a job in interactive mode

To allocate resources on the cluster interactively we will use the SLURM command `salloc`. The `salloc` command is used to allocate a SLURM job allocation, which is a set of resources (nodes), possibly with some set of constraints (e.g. number of processors per node, or memory per processor). When `salloc` successfully obtains the requested allocation, the user can run commands directly on the compute node. Finally, when the allocation time is up, `salloc` relinquishes the job. 

From the login node type:
```bash
salloc -n 1 --time=0:10:0 --mem-per-cpu=3g --account=account-name
```
As you notice, the `salloc` command requires a few user inputs:
- `-n`: the number of processors.
- `--time`: for how long you are requesting the resources. The format is `hh:mm:ss`.
- `--mem-per-cpu`: amount of memory to assign to each CPU. This is a very important parameter, and it will be clear in later sections of this course how to properly select it.
- `--account-name`: this is the **group** name on the HPC system, which is an alias of the Research Allocation Project Identifier (RAPI). Typically **group** names follow this convention (where `xx` represents a series of numbers):
        - Default: `def-[profname][-xx]`
        - Priority: `rrg-[profname][-xx]`
        - Cloud: `crg-[profname][-xx]`

The `salloc` can be customized based on user preference and needs. To learn more about SLURM and `salloc` click **[HERE](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html)**.

These parameters along with the current system utilization will decide how much time it will take for the queue manager to allocate the resources. For instance, requesting 2 processors will take much less time than requesting 512, and a 10 minutes long job will be allocated much faster than a 20 hours one. 

Here are a few **limits** to keep in mind when acclocating resources on an Alliance HPC system: **Niagara** accepts jobs of up to 24 hours run-time, **Béluga**, **Graham** and **Narval** up to 7 days, and **Cedar** up to 28 days. On the general-purpose clusters, longer jobs are restricted to use **only a fraction of the cluster by partitions**. There are partitions for jobs of

- 3 hours or less,
- 12 hours or less,
- 24 hours (1 day) or less,
- 72 hours (3 days) or less,
- 7 days or less, and
- 28 days or less

Because any job of 3 hours is also less than 12 hours, 24 hours, and so on, shorter jobs can always run in partitions with longer time-limits. A shorter job will have more scheduling opportunities than an otherwise-identical longer job. At **Béluga** a minimum time limit of 1 hour is also imposed. More about job scheduling policies can be found [HERE](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Job_scheduling_policies).

Upon pressing enter, the output should be similar to this:

```bash
    salloc: Pending job allocation 24928305
    salloc: job 24928305 queued and waiting for resources
    salloc: job 24928305 has been allocated resources
    salloc: Granted job allocation 24928305
    salloc: Waiting for resource configuration
    salloc: Nodes gra287 are ready for job
```

In these steps SLURM tells us that a job with ID 24928305 has been created for us, that it is in the queue and waiting for resources, and, eventually, that the resources have been found and granted. Finally, the resources have been configured and a node `gra287` is now ready for our task. You will also notice that the command line prompt name has changed to:

```bash
[username@gra287 ~]$
```

This means we are not sitting anymore on the login node, but we are now **on a compute node** whose identifier is **gra287**. One might ask: **now that I am on a compute node, how do I run my code that is sitting in my `/home` directory?** And here is a beautiful feature of a computer cluster: upon running the `ls` command from the compute node, you will realize that although you are on a complete different node you are still able to see the exact same files and directories you had in your home. That is due to the architecture of the cluster which works with a **distributed shared memory** system. That means you will be able to run your code or access your files from anywhere in the cluster. You can check the status of your job at any time by using the SLURM command `squeue -u username` or simply `sq`. If you open a new command line window, log into Graham and from the login node type `sq`, here is what you'll see:

```bash title="Pending Job"
[username@gra287 ~]$ sq
          JOBID     USER      ACCOUNT           NAME  ST  TIME_LEFT NODES CPUS TRES_PER_N MIN_MEM NODELIST (REASON)
       24928305 username account-name    interactive  PD       9:57     1    1        N/A      3G gra287 (None)
```
```bash title="Running Job"
[username@gra287 ~]$ sq
          JOBID     USER      ACCOUNT           NAME  ST  TIME_LEFT NODES CPUS TRES_PER_N MIN_MEM NODELIST (REASON)
       24928305 username account-name    interactive   R       9:57     1    1        N/A      3G gra287 (None)
```

Some important things to notice:
1. The job name is "interactive", as we were expecting.
2. The status `ST` is pending `PD` in the first extract, and running `R` in the second.
3. The number of nodes and number of CPUs should reflect what was defined by the `salloc` command.

If you want to stop/cancel the job at once, you can use the command `scancel` followed by the job ID. In our case:
```bash
[username@gra287 ~]$ scancel 24928305
```
With the command `salloc` we ran earlier, we requested allocation for 10 minutes. Once the requested time is over, SLURM will automatically release the resources and you will be back to the login node. Here is the message you'll receive when the time is over:

```bash
[username@gra287 ~]$ salloc: Job 24928305 has exceeded its time
         limit and its allocation has been revoked. srun: Job step
         aborted: Waiting up to 62 seconds for job step to finish.
         slurmstepd: error: *** STEP 24928305.interactive ON gra287 
         CANCELLED AT 2024-01-27T23:38:18 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
         exit
[username@gra-login2 ~]$ 
```

### Submitting a job in noninteractive mode

Most of the time, it's not necessary for the user to interact with compute node, therefore the most common way of running a job on the cluster is by submitting a script to SLURM. Think of it as if you are ordering food at a restaurant: your order is written on a piece of paper (batch script), which is then given to the restaurant manager (queue manager) to find a table who sends the order to the kitchen (allocating the resources and running). Your order might be executed directly or wait in a queue depending on how busy the restaurant is. The batch file is usually divided in two parts:
1. In the first part you will give SLURM all the directives (or options) for the job. Each line containing these parameters must be preceded with `#SBATCH` in the script. All available directives are described on the **[sbatch page](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html)**.
2. In the second part you will specify any commands that must be executed as part of the job.

A very simple batch script might look like this:

```bash frame="none"
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -t 0-10:00
#SBATCH --account=account-name
#SBATCH -o output.log

./myfirstjob.py
```
In the above example, `./myfirstjob.py` is standard python script that will run. On general-purpose (GP) clusters, this job reserves 1 core and 256MB of memory for 15 minutes. Now that you know how to allocate resources on the cluster, **you are ready to run computations!** However, you might be wondering: **how do I install my CFD package on the cluster?** Here comes yet another, very beautiful feature of most supercomputers, which is the **module system**.

## The module system

The module system is a concept available on most clusters worldwide and guarantees the use of different software (and different versions of the same software) in a precise and controlled manner. In most cases, a supercomputer has far more software installed than the average user will ever need. Therefore, the settings for all these software packages and their supported versions are encapsulated in "environment modules" maintained by the module system. These modules are in no way related to  modules in `perl` or `python` and should not be confused with that. To have an idea of what modules are already installed on your current profile, from the login node run the command:

```bash
[username@gra-login1 ~]$ module list
```

You will notice that some basic modules such as `openmpi`, `python`, or `intel` may be already installed. If the module or software you look for is not in the list of the modules installed, run the command:

```bash
[username@gra-login1 ~]$ module avail
```
to know what modules are available on this particular cluster. What you will notice is that:
1. There are a number of different versions of the same software.
2. The modules are organized and colour-coded based on discipline. For instance, `bio` stands for modules in Bioinformatic libraries/apps and `phys` stands for modules in Physics libraries/apps.
3. If you are in the CFD field, there are common softwares such as `starccm`, `openfoam`, and `gmsh`.
4. Modules can be entire software such as `openfoam` and `paraview`, or libraries such as `fftw` or `hdf5`.

**Standard environments** identify combinations of specific compiler and MPI modules that are used most commonly by our team to build other software. These combinations are grouped in modules named `StdEnv`. As of February 2023, there are four such standard environments, versioned `2023`, `2020`, `2018.3` and `2016.4`, with each new version incorporating major improvements. **Only versions 2020 and 2023 are actively supported**. To learn more about the module system on Alliance clusters click **[HERE](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Available_software)**.

Once you have chosen the module you need, all you do is run the command:
```bash
[username@gra-login1 ~]$ module load <modulename>
```
:::caution
1. When loading a module it is also a good practice to check if the desired module has some dependencies that must be loaded first by typing `module spider <modulename>`.
2. When loading a module it is also a good practice to load the exact version of the software you are looking for by typing `module load <modulename/X.X.X>` where `X.X.X` is the version number.
3. The modules you load will only survive on your profile for the duration of the session. Once you log out of the login node the modules previously loaded will be lost and you will need to reload them again.
4. Following (3), modules need to be re-loaded on compute nodes. 
:::

However, if you are happy with the loaded module and you know that you will use them constantly, you can run the command:
```bash
    [username@gra-login1 ~]$ module save
```
to save the current module setting as the **default** configuration. There are several other useful commands in the module system environment such as `module purge` to unload all the modules currently installed, and `module switch x y` to switch module `x` with module `y`. And now you are REALLY ready to run you first job on the cluster!

## Example: my first job
In this very simple example code we check if a specific year is a leap year. **Try running this code on the cluster using all the methods learned so far**.


<CodeFetch rawURL='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARC4CFD/arc4cfd/master/Section1/isleap.py' lang='python' meta="title='isleap.py'" />

The first option we have is to run the script directly in the login node. Upon checking if the python module has been loaded, from the login node we simply type:

```bash title="Running from login node" 
[username@gra-login2 ~]$ python ./isleap.py 2024
    2024 is a leap year
```


The second option is to run the script in a compute node in interactive mode. The first step as mentioned previously is allocating the resources:

```bash title="Running in interactive mode"
salloc -n 1 --time=0:10:0 --mem-per-cpu=500m --account=account-name
```
Here we requested a single processor for 10 minutes with 500 Mb of memory (more than enough for the task at hand).

The third and final option is to run the script by submitting a batch script to SLURM. Let's create a file ``firstjob.sh" to give all the necessary information about the job. The batch script will look something like:


<CodeFetch rawURL='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARC4CFD/arc4cfd/master/Section1/firstjob.sh' lang='bash' meta='title="firstjob.sh"' />

Because the submitted job will run unsupervised, it is good practice to ask SLURM to produce an **output file** (ileap.out) in which the output of our code will be printed, and an **error file** (isleap.err) in which the error message will be printed in case there is a problem. To run the batch script simply type:

```bash title="Submitting a batch script"
[username@gra-login2 ~]$ sbatch firstjob.sh 
    Submitted batch job 25017005
```

Once again, you can check the status of your simulation by running the command **squeue -u** or **sq**, and upon completion, you will notice that a new file has been created in your current directory named ``isleap.out", the content of which is exactly:

```bash frame="none"
[username@gra-login2 ~]$ vim isleap.out 
    2024 is a leap year
```

You will also notice that the file ``isleap.err" has been created, however its content is empty as no error was encountered during execution. Finally, note that the number of tasks requested of SLURM is the number of processes that will be started by srun. Because this code is not written in parallel mode, if more tasks are selected, the different CPUs will all perform the same operation. **TASK**: in the previous example, modify the batch script to ask for 4 processors, and run the job again. **What does the output look like?**

## A bit of terminology, AGAIN

Before we move to the next section of the course, there are a couple of concepts we need to first familiarize with. These are:
1. The concept of **time** in computing, and
2. The concept of **efficient use** of HPC resources.

### Time in computing
In HPC terminology there are two key definitions we need to be very comfortable with:

1. **Walltime**: or more precisely ``elapsed real time" is the length of time, measured in seconds, that a program takes to run (e.g. execute all its assigned tasks). The walltime is **independent** of how many resources are used; it is the time it takes according to a clock mounted on the wall. 

2. **CPU hours**: is the amount of CPU time spent processing. Imagine, for example, to execute a program for a walltime of 1 hour on 32 CPUs. **We will have used up to 32 CPU hours**.

### Efficient use of HPC resources
We introduced the concept of performance in ``computing" earlier when discussing about **FLOPS** and **clock speed** node, however these concepts need to be revisited in the context of HPC clusters where we have a large amount of CPUs (or nodes) available.

Say that you are a professional copyist. After your long experience you have optimized your workflow so that you copy an entire page of a manuscript with no difficulty. However, if you are now tasked with copying a 1000-pages manuscript, despite your talent it will probably take you a **LONG** time, more than any employer will ever wait for. A very simple solution would be to delegate some of the workload to 9 other copyists that could assist you (while of course communicating between each other), increasing the chances of getting the work done much faster. In very simple terms, our goal will be to distribute the workload effectively and efficiently over the resources we have available, in order to reach the final result in a reasonable time frame.

If you are taking this course, you are probably an **application user** and not an **application developer**, meaning that you are not really interested in developing more efficient CFD tools, but rather in using your favourite CFD package as efficiently as possible. **Making our workflow more efficient will be the basis of the next section**.

2. **CPU hours**: is the amount of CPU time spent processing. Imagine, for example, to execute a program for a walltime of 1 hour on 32 CPUs. **We will have used up to 32 CPU hours**. 

Now the question left to answer is **can we improve performance?** This will be the basis of the next section, and the answer is YES. If you are taking this course, you are probably an **application user** and not an **application developer**, meaning that you are not really interested in developing more efficient CFD tools, but rather in using your favourite CFD package as efficiently as possible. If that is the case, you have two ways of improving the performance: (i) use more nodes and consequently more CPUs will allow us to tackle a larger workload, and (ii) reducing the frequency of **file writing** in the code. When performing very long computations sometimes is useful to take an "instantaneous snapshot" to check progress and to make sure everything is running as expected, however it can be quite expensive. Reducing the frequency of file writing can have a surprisingly positive impact on the overall performance.*/}
