The prerequisites for the course are as follows:

* University-level knowledge in fluid dynamics
* Introductory knowledge of Computational Fluid Dynamics
* Familiarity with navigating terminal and bash commands

The students that do not have the prerequisite knowledge can consult the Resources page for additional content to supplement their knowledge.

The hands-on examples in the course use entirely open-source software. More specifically: Gmsh (meshing),  SU2 and Open-Foam (CFD solver), and Python and Paraview (visualization). Other open-source CFD-related software is listed [here](https://arc4cfd.github.io/cfd_codes/).

This course is developed for usage on the [Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://alliancecan.ca/en) although many of the concepts are applicable to most modern HPC systems. If you are eligible and want to gain access to the Alliance system, please visit the [registration website](https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/account-management/apply-account). New users should follow the training offered by the [host sites](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Getting_started).
