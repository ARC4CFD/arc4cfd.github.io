The measurement of CLmaxat a Reynolds number of 2-88 x 10 6 is uncertain for two reasons. On the one hand, a laminar separation bubble disappears intermittently for reasons that are not fully understood. On the other, it was found that the flow broke down into a three-dimensional pattern when an appreciable extent of separation was present. This is a major problem. Boundary-layer control by suction in the vicinity of the wing/wall junction is shown to improve the two-dimensionality in the early stages of separation, but does not inhibit the appearance of three-dimensional flow at and beyond the stall.},

	abstract = {We perform direct numerical simulation of flow past the NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) 0012 airfoil with partially covered wavy roughness elements near the leading edge. The Reynolds number Rec based on the freestream velocity (U0) and airfoil chord length (C), and the angle of attack (AoA) is fixed, i.e., Rec ¼ 5 Â 104; AoA ¼ 10 . The leading edge roughness elements are characterized by streamwise sinusoidal-wave geometry that is uniform in the spanwise direction with fixed height, whereas varying wave numbers (k) from 0 to 12. Based on the validation of the smooth baseline case (k ¼ 0), the roughness effects on the aerodynamic performance are evaluated in terms of the lift and drag coefficients. The drag coefficient decreases monotonically with k, while the variation of the lift coefficient with k is similar to the “drag crisis” phenomenon observed in cylinder flows. The sharp variations of lift and drag coefficients from k ¼ 6 to 8 indicate that k ¼ 8 is a critical case, beyond which massive separation occurs and almost covers the airfoil’s suction side and dominates the airfoil aerodynamic performance. To further reveal the underlying mechanism, the flow structures, pressure, skin friction coefficients, shear layer transition onset, and boundary layer separation are quantified to investigate the roughness effects. The roughness elements strongly modify the separation behavior, whereas they have little effect on the transition onset. The unsteady interactions and convections of separation bubbles downward the trailing edge also change the wake evolution. Based on the scaling of the asymmetric wake profiles, we find that the wake defect is gently decreasing with k, but the increase in the wake width is much stronger. This scaling analysis gains a better insight into the roughness effects on the momentum deficit flow rate, which confirms the drag mechanism with different roughness wave numbers.},

The angles of attack are 5 and 15 degrees at the low and the moderate Reynolds number cases respectively. The three-dimensional unsteady compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using higher order compact schemes. The flow field in the low Reynolds number case consists of a long separation bubble near the leading-edge region and an attached boundary layer on the aft part of the airfoil. The shear layer that formed in the separated region persisted up to the end of the airfoil. The roles of the turbulent diffusion, advection, and dissipation terms in the turbulent kinetic-energy balance equation change as the boundary layer evolves over the airfoil. In the higher Reynolds number case, the leading-edge separation bubble is very small in length and in height. A fully developed turbulent boundary layer is observed in a short distance downstream of the reattachment point. The boundary layer velocity near the wall gradually decreases along the airfoil. Eventually, the boundary layer separates near the trailing edge. The Reynolds stresses peak in the outer part of the boundary layer and the maximum amplitude also gradually increases along the chord.},

The crux of the difficulty is the large number of relevant roughness topographies and the high cost of testing each topography, but computational and experimental advances in the last decade or so have been lowering these barriers. In light of these advances, here we review the underpinnings and limits of relationships between roughness topography and drag behavior, focusing on canonical and fully turbulent incompressible flow over rigid roughness. These advances are beginning to spill over into multiphysical areas of roughness, such as heat transfer, and promise broad increases in predictive reliability.},

	abstract = {The use of spanwise waviness in wings has been proposed in the literature as a possible mechanism for obtaining improved aerodynamic characteristics, motivated by the tubercles that cover the leading edge of the pectoral ﬂippers of the humpback whale. We investigate the effect of this type of waviness on the incompressible ﬂow around inﬁnite wings with a NACA0012 proﬁle, using direct numerical simulations employing the spectral/hp method. Simulations were performed for Reynolds numbers of Re = 10 000 and Re = 50 000, considering different angles of attack in both the pre-stall and post-stall regimes. The results show that the waviness can either increase or decrease the lift coefﬁcient, depending on the particular Re and ﬂow regime. We observe that the ﬂow around the wavy wing exhibits a tendency to remain attached behind the waviness peak, with separation restricted to the troughs, which is consistent with results from the literature. Then, we identify three important physical mechanisms in this ﬂow. The ﬁrst mechanism is the weakening of the suction peak on the sections corresponding to the waviness peaks. This characteristic had been observed in a previous investigation for a very low Reynolds number of Re = 1000, and we show that this is still important even at Re = 50 000. As a second mechanism, the waviness has a signiﬁcant effect on the stability of the separated shear layers, with transition occurring earlier for the wavy wing. In the pre-stall regime, for Re = 10 000, the ﬂow around the baseline wing is completely laminar, and the earlier transition leads to a large increase in the lift coefﬁcient, while for Re = 50 000, the earlier transition leads to a shortening of the separation bubble which does not lead to an increased lift coefﬁcient. The last mechanism corresponds to a sub-harmonic behaviour, with the ﬂow being notably different between subsequent wavelengths. This allows the wing to maintain higher lift coefﬁcients in some portions of the span.},

Experiments were applied on the clean airfoil, runback ice, horn ice, and spanwise ridge ice at a Reynolds number of 0.6 Â 106 over angles of attack from À8° to 20°, and then results are compared. Generally, it is found that ice accretion on the airfoil can contribute to formation of a ﬂow separation bubble on the upper surface downstream from the leading edge. In addition, it is made clear that spanwise ridge ice provides the greatest negative effect on the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil. In this case, the stall angle drops about 10° and the maximum lift coefﬁcient reduces about 50\% which is hazardous for an airplane. While horn ice leads to a stall angle drop of about 4° and a maximum lift coefﬁcient reduction to 21\%, runback ice has the least effect on the ﬂow pattern around the airfoil and the aerodynamic coefﬁcients so as the stall angle decreases 2° and the maximum lift reduces about 8\%.},

This paper takes the icing data of the NACA 23012 airfoil as an example, establishes an icing influence model for real-time simulation based on icing time and aircraft angle of attack, and analyzes the influence of different icing geometry on aircraft characteristics. The two-dimensional interpolation method is used to improve the model of the aircraft’s stall area, which is mainly divided into the correction of the lift-drag coefficient linear area and the stall area and the correction of the aircraft stability derivative and the control derivative. The aerodynamic equation of the airplane after icing is established, and the modal analysis of the airplane under different icing conditions is completed through the linearization of the flight equation. The closed-loop simulation system of the altitude holding mode and roll attitude holding mode is used to calculate and analyze the flight quality changes of the aircraft after the wing surface is frozen. The analysis results show that, under icing conditions, in the range of small angles of attack, icing has no obvious influence on the aircraft mode. As the degree of icing increases, the throttle skewness and the negative deflection angle of the airplane’s level flight requirements continue to increase. The case of icing flight in altitude hold and roll hold modes shows that flying in the autopilot mode under severe icing conditions is very dangerous and is prone to cause the aircraft to stall.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric icing can cause up to 16\% of weather-related aircraft accidents. Ice accretions on an aircraft lead to a decrease of the aerodynamic performance and can obstruct critical sensors. Predicting the ice accretion location and shape can allow to efficiently fight against it. During the past two decades, numerical simulation of aircraft icing became a powerful complementary tool to experimental measurements. Most of the icing codes rely on the coupling between the air solution provided by CFD, a droplet solver to estimate the impingement on the geometry, and an ice accretion solver. The ice accretion solver often uses the Messinger approaches to compute the ice growth, but other numerical methods have emerged, such as the shallow water icing model (SWIM). The objective of the paper is to extend the capabilities of the open-source SU2 CFD software to ice accretion simulations by implementing the SWIM model and to verify the rime ice shape predictions. After a presentation of the model equations and implementation, the 3D results of ice accretion for the test cases NASA27 and NASA28 around a NACA0012 wing will be shown and compared to existing literature.},

	abstract = {A method to simulate ice accretion on an aircraft wing using a three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes solver, a Eulerian droplet flow field model, a mesh morphing model, and a thermodynamic model, is presented in this paper. The above models are combined together into one solver and implemented in OpenFOAM. Two-way coupling is achieved between airflow field calculation and ice simulation. The density-based solver rhoEnergyFoam is used to calculate the airflow field. The roughness wall function is proposed to simulate the roughness effect caused by ice accretion. For droplet flow field calculation, the Eulerian model is applied and the permeable wall boundary condition is used on the wing to simulate the droplet impingement. The icing thermodynamic model is built based on the Messinger model. The mesh morphing model adjusts the wing’s shape every time step based on the amount of accreted ice so that the airflow field is updated during the simulation. The effect of the ice accretion on the airflow is studied by comparing the aerodynamic performance—with and without ice. The ice accretion on the ONERA M6 wing model under a specific condition has been simulated to validate the solver’s performance and investigate the effect of the accreted ice on the aerodynamic performance.},

	abstract = {Determining the aero-icing characteristics is key for safety assurance in aviation, but it may be a computationally expensive task. This work presents a framework for the development of low-dimensional models for application to aerofoil icing. The framework builds on: an adaptive sampling strategy to identify the local, nonlinear features across the icing envelope for continuous intermittent icing; a classic technique based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, and a modern Neural Network architecture. The extreme diversity in simulated ice shapes, from smooth and streamlined to rugged and irregular shapes, motivated the use of an unsupervised classiﬁcation of the ice shapes. This allowed deploying the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition locally within each sub-region, sensibly improving the prediction accuracy over the global model. On the other hand, the Neural Network architecture and the convolutional auto-encoder were found insensitive to the complexity in ice shapes. A strong correlation was found to exist between the ice shape, resulting ice mass and aerodynamic performance of the iced aerofoil, both in terms of the average and variance. On average, rime ice causes a loss of maximum lift coefﬁcient of 21.5\% compared to a clean aerofoil, and the average ice thickness is 0.9\% of the aerofoil chord. For glaze ice, the average loss of maximum lift coefﬁcient is 46.5\% and the average ice thickness is 2.1\%. Glaze ice was also found to have three times more surface coverage than rime ice.},

The PoliMIce (Politecnico di Milano Ice accretion software) library provides a general interface allowing different aerodynamic and ice accretion software to communicate. The built-in ice accretion engine moves from the well-known Myers approach and it includes state-of-the-art ice formation models. The ice accretion engine implements a fully three-dimensional representation of the two-phase ﬂow over the solid body, accounting for both rime and glaze ice formation. As an improvement over the reference model, a parabolic temperature proﬁle is assumed to guarantee the consistency with respect to the wall boundary conditions. Moreover, the mass balance is generalized to conserve the liquid fraction at the interface between the glaze and the rime ice types. Numerical simulations are presented regarding in-ﬂight ice accretion over two-dimensional airfoils and three-dimensional straight- and swept-wings. The CFD open-source software OpenFOAM was used to compute the aerodynamic ﬁeld and the droplet trajectories. Simulation results compare fairly well with available experiments on ice accretion.},

This article identifies four classes of ice accretions: roughness, horn ice, streamwise ice, and spanwise-ridge ice. For each class, the key flowfield features such as flowfield separation and reattachment are discussed and how these contribute to the known aerodynamic effects of these ice shapes.

	abstract = {Natural ice accretion on the lifting surface of an aircraft is detrimental to its aerodynamic performance, as it changes the effective streamlined body. The main focus of this work considers the optimization design of airfoils under atmospheric icing conditions for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The ice formation process is simulated by the Eulerian approach and the three-dimensional Myers model. A three-equation turbulence model is implemented to accurately predict the stall performance of the iced airfoil. In recognition of the real atmospheric variability in the icing parameters, the medium volume diameter of supercooled water droplets is treated as an uncertainty with an assumed probability density function. A technique of polynomial chaos expansion is used to propagate the input uncertainty through the deterministic system. The numerical results show that the multipoint/multiobjective optimization strategy can efﬁciently improve both the ice tolerance and the cruise performance of an airfoil. The reason for the focus on robust optimization is that the ice angle of the optimized airfoil becomes less critical to the incoming ﬂow. The optimized airfoils are applied to a UAV platform, in which the performance improvement and the relevant key ﬂow feature are both preserved.},

A few examples of supercooled large droplet icing conditions were included. To verify the aerodynamic performance measurements, molds were made of selected ice shapes formed in the icing tunnel. Castings of the ice were made and placed on a model in a dry low-turbulence wind tunnel, and precision aerodynamic performance measurements were taken. Documentation is included in this report of all ice shapes produced and the aerodynamic performance measurements made during the icing tunnel tests.

Different methods for determination of ice shapes as well as procedures are presented, and their characteristics are compared and analyzed. Based on the Combination Airfoil Assumption first presented by Glahn et al and developed by Farooq Saeed, we suggest a simple and useful method to determine the critical ice shapes on a normal airfoil which can be called combination airfoil comparison method. This method can be used to quickly get a preliminary ice shape for icing certification, but its criticality should be verified by other means of determining critical ice shapes. In order to examine the availability of this method, examples of Airbus aircraft types that have passed icing certification will be given. We hope that our findings and recommendations will be helpful to the applicant and icing certification team during aircraft icing certification.},

This work primarily focuses on the flow physics at Reynolds numbers (Rec = 455 000) within the Reynolds number independent regime of the airfoil. The present work illuminates our understanding of the flow phenomena as well as provides a validation dataset for future numerical work. From the acquired data, the mean velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and mean vorticity have been estimated. The results show how the different contamination geometries affect the point of separation. It is also shown that the intermittency of the flow behind horn-shaped contamination is dependent on the angle-of-attack, even at angles above stall. Proper orthogonal decomposition was performed on the velocity fields to identify whether reduced order modelling is an appropriate tool for rapid estimation of these flows. It was found that a limited number of modes carried a large fraction of the fluctuating energy, demonstrating that reduced order modelling is feasible.},

Spoiler-ice shapes with heights of I.5in and 3.0-in were tested with the 24-inch chord airfoil. For the 1Zinch chord airfoil, the corresponding spoiler-ice heights were 0.75in and 1.5in and were obtained from geometric scaling. Lift, drag, pitching moment, and pressure coefficients were obtained with both airfoils for angles of attack ranging from -8 to +17 degrees. The experimental results showed substantial penalties in airfoil aerodynamic performance due to the simulated ice shapes.},

Aerodynamic performance coefficients and pressure profile were calculated and compared with the available measurements for a chord Reynolds number of 1.83×106. Ice shapes were simulated with flat plates (spoiler-ice) extending along the span of the wing. Lift, drag, and pressure coefficients were calculated in zero angle of attack through the steady state and transient simulations. Different approaches of numerical studies have been applied to investigate the icing conditions on the blades. The simulated separated flow over the sharp spoilers is challenging and can be seen as a worst test case for validation.

These lead to degraded aerodynamic performances and lower power output. Here, a high-fidelity multi-step method is presented and applied to simulate a 3-hour rime icing event on the NREL 5 MW wind turbine blade. Five sections belonging to the outer half of the blade were considered. Independent time steps were applied to each blade section to obtain detailed ice 5 shapes. The roughness effect on airfoil performance was included in CFD simulations using an equivalent sand-grain approach. The aerodynamic coefficients of the iced sections were computed considering two different roughness heights and extensions along the blade surface. The power curve before and after the icing event was computed according to the Design Load Case 1.1 of the International Electrotechnical Commission. In the icing event under analysis, the decrease in power output strongly depended on wind speed and, in fact, tip-speed ratio. Regarding the different roughness heights and extensions along the blade, 10 power losses were qualitatively similar but significantly different in magnitude, despite the well-developed ice shapes. It was found that extended roughness regions in the chordwise direction of the blade can become as detrimental as the ice shape itself.},

	abstract = {This article is a systematic and comprehensive review, correlation, and assessment of test results available in the public domain which address the aerodynamic performance and control degradations caused by various types of ice accretions on the lifting surfaces of ﬁxed wing aircraft. To help put the various test results in perspective, overviews are provided ﬁrst of the important factors and limitations involved in computational and experimental icing simulation techniques, as well as key aerodynamic testing simulation variables and governing ﬂow physics issues. Following these are the actual reviews, assessments, and correlations of a large number of experimental measurements of various forms of mostly simulated in-ﬂight and ground ice accretions, augmented where appropriate by similar measurements for other analogous forms of surface contamination and/or disruptions. In-ﬂight icing categories reviewed include the initial and inter-cycle ice accretions inherent in the use of de-icing systems which are of particular concern because of widespread misconceptions about the thickness of such accretions which can be allowed before any serious consequences occur, and the runback/ridge ice accretions typically associated with larger-than-normal water droplet encounters which are of major concern because of the possible potential for catastrophic reductions in aerodynamic effectiveness. The other in-ﬂight ice accretion category considered includes the more familiar large rime and glaze ice accretions, including ice shapes with rather grotesque features, where the concern is that, in spite of all the research conducted to date, the upper limit of penalties possible has probably not been deﬁned. Lastly, the effects of various possible ground frost/ice accretions are considered. The concern with some of these is that for some types of conﬁgurations, all of the normally available operating margins to stall at takeoff may be erased if these accretions are not adequately removed prior to takeoff. Throughout this review, important voids in the available database are highlighted, as are instances where previous lessons learned have tended to be overlooked. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Icephobic coatings for aircraft and other surfaces subjected to ice accretion have generated great interest in the past two decades, due to the advancement of nanomaterials, coating fabrication methods, biomimetics, and a more in-depth understanding of ice nucleation and ice adhesion. Icephobic coatings have demonstrated the ability to repel water droplets, delay ice nucleation and signiﬁcantly reduce ice adhesion. Despite these ongoing research activities and promising results, the ﬁndings reported hereafter suggest that coatings alone cannot be used for aircraft anti-icing and de-icing operations; rather, they should be considered as a complementary option to either thermal or mechanical ice protection methods, for reducing power consumption and the ecological footprint of these active systems and for expediting ground de-icing operations. This paper will ﬁrst review the state-of-the-art of icephobic coatings for various applications, including their performance and existing deﬁciencies. The second part of this paper focuses on aerospace anti-icing and de-icing requirements and the need for hybrid systems to provide a complete ice protection solution.

	abstract = {An experimental study was conducted to examine the dynamic ice accretion process over the surface of a highvoltage power transmission cable model and characterize the eﬀects of the ice accretion on the aerodynamic forces acting on the test model. The experimental study was carried out by leveraging the unique Icing Research Tunnel of Iowa State University (i.e., ISU-IRT) to generate typical wet glaze and dry rime icing conditions experienced by power transmission cables. A cylindrical power cable model, which has the same diameter as that of typical power transmission cables, was mounted in ISU-IRT for the ice accretion experiments. In addition to using a high-speed digital imaging system to record the dynamic ice accretion process, a novel digital image projection (DIP) based technique was utilized to quantify the 3D shapes of the ice structures accreted on the surface of the power cable model as a function of the ice accretion time. The time variations of the aerodynamic drag force acting on the test model during the dynamic ice accretion process were also measured quantitatively by using high-sensitive force/moment traducers mounted at two ends of the test model. The ice structures accreted over the surface of the power cable model were found to change signiﬁcantly under diﬀerent icing conditions (i.e., rime icing vs. glaze icing). The characteristics of the aerodynamic drag acting on the test model was found to vary signiﬁcantly during the dynamic ice accretion process depending on what types of ice structures were accreted on the test model. The acquired snapshots of the ice accretion images and the measured 3D shapes of the accreted ice structures on the test model are correlated with the aerodynamic force measurement results to elucidate the underlying physics.},

	abstract = {Detailed measurements of the size of roughness elements on ice accreted on models in the NASA Lewis Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) were made in a previous study. Only limited data from that study have been published, but included were the roughness element height, diameter and spacing. In the present study, the height and spacing data were found to correlate with the element diameter, and the diameter was found to be a function primarily of the non-dimensional parameters freezing fraction and accemulation parameter. The width of the smooth zone which forms at the leading edge of the model was found to decrease with increa\_ ing accumulation parameter. Although preliminmy, the success of these correlations suggests that it may be possible to develop simple relationships between ice roughness and icing conditions for use in ice-accretionprediction codes. These codes now require an iceroughness estimate to determine convective heat transfer. Studies using a 7.6-cm-diameter cylinder and a 53.3-¢m-chord NACA 0012 airfoil were also performed in which a ½-min icing spray at an initial set of conditions was followed by a 9\_A-min spray at a second set of conditions. The resulting ice shape was compared with that from a full lO-min spray at the second set of conditions. The initial ice accumulation appeared to have no effect on the final ice shape. From this result, it would appear that aocreting ice is affected very little by the initial roughness or shape features.},

This paper takes the icing data of the NACA 23012 airfoil as an example, establishes an icing influence model for real-time simulation based on icing time and aircraft angle of attack, and analyzes the influence of different icing geometry on aircraft characteristics. The two-dimensional interpolation method is used to improve the model of the aircraft’s stall area, which is mainly divided into the correction of the lift-drag coefficient linear area and the stall area and the correction of the aircraft stability derivative and the control derivative. The aerodynamic equation of the airplane after icing is established, and the modal analysis of the airplane under different icing conditions is completed through the linearization of the flight equation. The closed-loop simulation system of the altitude holding mode and roll attitude holding mode is used to calculate and analyze the flight quality changes of the aircraft after the wing surface is frozen. The analysis results show that, under icing conditions, in the range of small angles of attack, icing has no obvious influence on the aircraft mode. As the degree of icing increases, the throttle skewness and the negative deflection angle of the airplane’s level flight requirements continue to increase. The case of icing flight in altitude hold and roll hold modes shows that flying in the autopilot mode under severe icing conditions is very dangerous and is prone to cause the aircraft to stall.},

In our previous work (Kumar et al., Journal of Turbulence, Vol. 22, No. 11, 2021, pp. 735–760), we found stationary spanwise inhomogeneities in the form of alternating regions of fast- and slow-moving fluid, which were termed “flow channels.” In the present study we investigate further this phenomenon. We observe the formation of hairpin vortices downstream of the roughness elements, which eventually merge; this causes the formation of wider channels that remain coherent and affect the trailing-edge separation. With increasing angle of attack, the intensity of flow channeling can increase or decrease depending on the topology of the leading-edge roughness. Its effect on the trailing-edge separation remains, however, significant. The mean-separation line is highly distorted, and the separation length can vary by up to 30\% of the chord length along the span.},

For a ﬁxed drop volume, multiple metastable states are obtained at two different surface roughnesses. Unusual and noncircular shape of the three-phase contact line of a liquid droplet sitting on the model surface is observed due to corrugation and distortion of the contact line by structure of the roughness. The contact angle varies along the contact line for each metastable state. The maximum and minimum contact angles among the multiple metastable states at a ﬁxed viewing angle correspond to the advancing and the receding contact angles, respectively. It is interesting to observe that the advancing/receding contact angles (and contact angle hysteresis) are a function of viewing angle. In addition, the receding (or advancing) contact angles at different viewing angles are determined at different metastable states. The contact angle of minimum energy among the multiple metastable states is deﬁned as the most stable (equilibrium) contact angle. The Wenzel model is not able to describe the contact angle along the three-phase contact line. The contact angle hysteresis at different drop volumes is determined.

We produced surfaces covered by micro-nanostructures of diﬀering sizes. We evaluated the anti-icing properties (delayed ice formation) and de-icing properties (reduced ice adhesion strength) of the produced surfaces that were subjected to two forms of icing conditions. The well-known ice adhesion measurement techniques, i.e., the centrifuge adhesion and push-oﬀ tests, provided quantitative comparisons of the ice adhesion strength of the produced surfaces. We observed two diﬀerent mechanical deformations during the ice detachment from the surfaces. Although both superhydrophobic surfaces reduced ice adhesion strength, the smaller surface micro-nanostructures produced a greater reduction in ice adhesion by favoring less ice interlocking with the surface asperities. To rigorously assess the durability of the produced surfaces, we carried out a comprehensive series of experiments that covered a wide range of real-life conditions. Under harsh environmental conditions, the surfaces maintained a water contact angle and contact angle hysteresis of {\textgreater} 150° and {\textless} 10°, respectively, thereby conﬁrming the resistance of the superhydrophobic silicone surfaces to severe chemical and mechanical damage. In some cases where water repellency was lost, the silicone rubber surfaces demonstrated a satisfactory recovery of their anti-wetting properties.},

	abstract = {Fracture-controlled surfaces solve the long-standing challenge of simultaneous low ice adhesion and high durability through accelerating crack nucleation and growth process at the ice–material interface.
          , 
            
              Icing imposes a significant burden on those living in cold climates, with negative impacts on infrastructure, transportation, and energy systems. Over the past few decades, a wide range of materials with ice-shedding characteristics have been developed, including surfaces that are non-wetting/hydrophobic, liquid-infused, stress-localized, and those with low interfacial toughness. Although many of these materials have demonstrated low ice adhesion in a laboratory setting, none have achieved widespread practical adoption. This is primarily a result of the fact that they tend to have very low durability, limiting their applicability. Thus, the primary challenge in developing ice-shedding materials is finding materials with both low ice adhesion AND good durability. Here, we introduce the concept of a so-called “fracture-controlled surface.” Through coordinated mechanical and chemical heterogeneity in the material structure, we affect the interfacial crack nucleation and growth on these surfaces. Through this controlled process, fracture-controlled surfaces exhibit both low ice adhesion and very high mechanical durability. Measurements of the durability of these surfaces indicate performance that is three orders of magnitude greater than other state-of-the-art ice-shedding materials. Physically,
              via
              mechanical heterogeneity of the material, we pre-specified the crack nucleation coordinates at the interface and guided the crack growth in an interfacial plane, with no kinking in other directions. This helps to maximize the energy that goes towards crack nucleation and growth. A detailed mathematical model is developed to predict adhesion of external solid objects on these materials. The model suggests that an elastic matching criterion is required to achieve minimal adhesion of solid objects on these materials. Fracture-controlled surfaces provide a rich material platform to guide future innovation of materials with minimal adhesion while having very high durability.},

Information on icing at low Reynolds numbers, as it is encountered by wind turbines and unmanned aerial vehicles, is less available, and few experimental datasets exist that can be used for validation of numerical tools. This study investigated the aerodynamic performance degradation on an S826 airfoil with 3D-printed ice shapes at Reynolds numbers Re = 2 × 105, 4 × 105, and 6 × 105. Three ice geometries were obtained from icing wind tunnel experiments, and an additional three geometries were generated with LEWICE. Experimental measurements of lift, drag, and pressure on the clean and iced airfoils have been conducted in the low-speed wind tunnel at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The results showed that the icing performance penalty correlated to the complexity of the ice geometry. The experimental data were compared to computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) simulations with the RANS solver FENSAP. Simulations were performed with two turbulence models (Spalart Allmaras and Menter’s k-ω SST). The simulation data showed good ﬁdelity for the clean and streamlined icing cases but had limitations for complex ice shapes and stall.},

	abstract = {We perform direct numerical simulation of flow past the NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) 0012 airfoil with partially covered wavy roughness elements near the leading edge. The Reynolds number Rec based on the freestream velocity (U0) and airfoil chord length (C), and the angle of attack (AoA) is fixed, i.e., Rec ¼ 5 Â 104; AoA ¼ 10 . The leading edge roughness elements are characterized by streamwise sinusoidal-wave geometry that is uniform in the spanwise direction with fixed height, whereas varying wave numbers (k) from 0 to 12. Based on the validation of the smooth baseline case (k ¼ 0), the roughness effects on the aerodynamic performance are evaluated in terms of the lift and drag coefficients. The drag coefficient decreases monotonically with k, while the variation of the lift coefficient with k is similar to the “drag crisis” phenomenon observed in cylinder flows. The sharp variations of lift and drag coefficients from k ¼ 6 to 8 indicate that k ¼ 8 is a critical case, beyond which massive separation occurs and almost covers the airfoil’s suction side and dominates the airfoil aerodynamic performance. To further reveal the underlying mechanism, the flow structures, pressure, skin friction coefficients, shear layer transition onset, and boundary layer separation are quantified to investigate the roughness effects. The roughness elements strongly modify the separation behavior, whereas they have little effect on the transition onset. The unsteady interactions and convections of separation bubbles downward the trailing edge also change the wake evolution. Based on the scaling of the asymmetric wake profiles, we find that the wake defect is gently decreasing with k, but the increase in the wake width is much stronger. This scaling analysis gains a better insight into the roughness effects on the momentum deficit flow rate, which confirms the drag mechanism with different roughness wave numbers.},

	abstract = {Ice accretion can lead to severe consequences in daily life and sometimes catastrophic events. To mitigate the hazard of icing, passive icephobic surfaces have drawn widespread attentions because of their abilities in repelling incoming water droplets, suppressing ice nucleation and/or lowering ice adhesion strength. As time elapses and temperature lowers sufﬁciently, ice accretion becomes inevitable, and a realistic roadmap to surface icephobicity for various outdoor anti-icing applications is to live with ice but with the lowest ice adhesion strength. In this review, surfaces with icephobicity are critically categorized into smooth surfaces, textured surfaces, slippery surfaces and sub-surface textured surfaces, and discussed in terms of theoretical limit, current status and perspectives. Particular attention is paid to multiple passive anti-icing strategies combined approaches as proposed on the basis of icephobic surfaces. Correlating the current strategies with one another will promote understanding of the key parameters in lowering ice adhesion strength. Finally, we provide remarks on the rational design of state-of-the-art icephobic surfaces with low ice adhesion strength.},

	abstract = {Icing simulations for wind turbine blades should consider the roughness-induced ﬂow transition. Adding a transport equation for ‘roughness ampliﬁcation’ to the Langtry-Menter model, the roughness-induced transition can be predicted for rough ﬂat plates. However, this approach exhibits a limitation that it cannot predict the skin friction in the shadow zone of blunt bodies. Such an approach depends on the boundary condition(s) of speciﬁc dissipation rate (u). Typically boundary conditions for turbulent kinetic energy (k) and u have been investigated for various roughness heights, but have been applied only for fully turbulent conditions. This study introduces an approach to predict the ﬂow transition and the skin friction for a roughened surface, whereby the Langtry-Menter model including roughness ampliﬁcation is coupled with the k and u boundary conditions. The proposed method shows good agreement with the experiments for turbulent onset and the distributions of skin friction and heat convection for a roughened ﬂat plate and a circular cylinder. Using the turbulent models under fully turbulent and transitional assumptions, the effects of the ﬂow transition on the ice accretion shape on a rotating wind turbine are compared. The modiﬁed turbulent model showed better performance for the icing simulations without any tuning.},

The review begins by establishing the fundamentals of the wetting phenomenon and wettability parameters. This is followed by the recent advances in modelling and simulations of the response of superhydrophobic surfaces to static and dynamic droplets contact and impingement, respectively. In view of their versatility and multifunctionality, a special attention is given to the development of these surfaces using nanocomposites. Furthermore, the review considers advances in icephobicity, its comprehensive characterization and its relation to superhydrophobicity.

Icephobic coatings have demonstrated the ability to repel water droplets, delay ice nucleation and signiﬁcantly reduce ice adhesion. Despite these ongoing research activities and promising results, the ﬁndings reported hereafter suggest that coatings alone cannot be used for aircraft anti-icing and de-icing operations; rather, they should be considered as a complementary option to either thermal or mechanical ice protection methods, for reducing power consumption and the ecological footprint of these active systems and for expediting ground de-icing operations. This paper will ﬁrst review the state-of-the-art of icephobic coatings for various applications, including their performance and existing deﬁciencies. The second part of this paper focuses on aerospace anti-icing and de-icing requirements and the need for hybrid systems to provide a complete ice protection solution.
