## Planning CFD simulations on HPC
Faced with a CFD workflow that could benefit from modern HPC infrastructure, the planning stage seeks to create an alignment between:  1) the scientific or engineering question that we seek to answer,  2) the physical reality of the problem we are hoping to simulate, and 3) the  abstracted CFD problem. 


The understanding of this alignment is necessary in order to adequetely estimate the HPC needs of a given problem.

The planning section requires a good physical understanding  of the underlying  problem in order to adequately assess.






## Parameters that influence HPC cost

Add the discussion from Ferziger Peric on page 315.
1. Type of turbulence modeling
2. Type of physical models used
3. Number of separate species to consider
4. Treatement of the wall boundary conditions 
5. Dimensionality of the problem
6. Order of numerical methods (accuracy)




## What do I need to resolve?
CFD simulations inevitably represent a compromise between resolution, accuracy, parameter space

Multiphase flows?
Combustion?
MHD?
Turbulence?
High-paramter design space?
Moving/deforming simulations?
Multispecies and chemical reactions?
