## Planning CFD simulations on HPC
Faced with a CFD workflow that could benefit from modern HPC infrastructure, the planning stage seeks to create an alignment between:   1) the physical reality of the fluid dynamic problem we are hoping to simulate, 2) the scientific or engineering question that we seek to answer,  and 3) the  abstracted CFD problem.

Identifying the underlying scientific or engineering question that the simulation seeks to answer helps to articulate the exact justification for the simulation. It also helps to assess the level of abstraction required for the CFD simulation.   It goes without saying that the planning stage requires a good physical understanding  of the underlying fluid problem. 



## Parameters that influence HPC cost
The overall HPC cost of a CFD simulation will be driven by three main categories of considerations, these are related to:

- **Physical or abstracted setup** 
	* *Dimensionality of the problem*
	* *Geomtric complexity of CFD*
	* *Unsteadiness*
	* *Multiphysics, multiphase, and/or multispecies*
	* *Physical time advancement needed*

- **Simulation parameters**
	* Type of turbulence modeling (RANS, LES, DNS)
	* Order of numerical methods (accuracy)
	* Type of boundary condition
	* Wall-resolved or wall modelled
	
- **Parametric space**
	* Number of simulations needed to cover the parametric space

### How to dermine the physical setup?

CFD simulations inevitably represent a compromise between resolution, accuracy, parameter space

Multiphase flows?
Combustion?
MHD?
Turbulence?
High-paramter design space?
Moving/deforming simulations?
Multispecies and chemical reactions?


With massively parallel computers, the low-Mach number formulation becomes highly challenging, because it involves solving large linear systems.






### What are the considerations for the simulation parameters?


### What parameters space do I need to cover?




## What do I need to resolve?







## EXAMPLE: Planning the simulation
We seek to simulate the flow the flow around an NACA4412 airfoil with a flap. 





**Scientific question**:
Seek to understand the buffeting frequency in between the airfoil/flap gap.


We must balance the need for accurate 

Is the flow over the airfoil critical to answer ? Can we simplify this problem to a simple representative problem? If yes, what are the potential limitations of the analysis?


Is 3 dimensional critical?

Is compressibility important? Is there a need for multiphysics computations (e.g. icing)? 

1. Select problem
2. Determine the desired level of abstraction
