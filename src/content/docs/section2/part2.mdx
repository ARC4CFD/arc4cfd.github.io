## Planning CFD simulations on HPC
Faced with a CFD workflow that could benefit from modern HPC infrastructure, the planning stage seeks to create an alignment between:   1) the physical reality of the fluid dynamic problem we are hoping to simulate, 2) the scientific or engineering question that we seek to answer,  and 3) the  abstracted CFD problem.

Identifying the underlying scientific or engineering question that the simulation seeks to answer helps to articulate the exact justification for the simulation. It also helps to assess the level of abstraction required for the CFD simulation.   It goes without saying that the planning stage requires a good physical understanding  of the underlying fluid problem. 



## Parameters that influence HPC cost
The overall HPC cost of a CFD simulation will be driven by three main categories of considerations, these are related to:

- **Physical or abstracted setup** 
	* *Dimensionality of the problem*
	* *Unsteadiness*
	* *Geometric complexity of CFD*
	* *Physics of the problem (inclusing multiphysics, multiphase, and/or multispecies)*
	* *Physical time advancement needed*
	* *Extent of the computational domain*
	* *Thermodynamic modelling*


- **Simulation parameters**
	* *Type of turbulence modeling* (RANS, LES, DNS)
	* *Order of numerical methods* (accuracy)
	* *Type of boundary condition*
	* *Wall-resolved or wall modelled*
	Moving/deforming simulations
	
- **Parametric space**
	* *Number of simulations needed to cover the parametric space*

### How to determine the physical setup?
The physical setup that will be simulated plays the largest role on the overall computational cost of the CFD. All physical fluid dynamic problems are inherently unsteady and three-dimensional. Yet, significant computational saving can be gained from simulating either a steady or a reduced dimensional order problem, these simplification may be sufficient to bypass the need for parallel computing.
{/* discuss a bit more here */}

##### Dimensionality of the problem
The dimensionality of the problem is an important consideration. Consider a three-dimensional simulation with $64\times 64\times 64$ grid points (or 262,144 grid points); if this problem would be reduced the local resolution requirement drops by 64 times! ($64\times 64=4,096$) This great computational benefit comes with a a number of caveats:

* Many problems are inherently and cannot be modelled as a two-dimensional problem (flow through pump or dispersion of pollutants, for example). 
* Turbulence is inherently three-dimensional. As RANS fully models the turbulence, it can be applied to a two-dimensional problem but the applicability of LES or DNS is more questionable
*  Only one component of vorticity can be represented in two-dimensions (instead of a full three-dimensional vector) and vortex stretching cannot occur.

##### Geometric complexity 
The reduction of the geometric complexity of the problem can also significantly reduce the computational cost of the CFD. Ultimately, we seek to omit any irrelevant geometrical details. These small geometric details require additional grid points to fully resolve, which are wasted computational resources if the details plays a negligeable role in the simulation results. If they are included without the necessary resolution, they can be the site of increased numerical error, local numerical instability, and/or can result in time-stepping limitations that can greatly penalize a large scale simulation. Determining which geometric details do not have an overall effect on the flow is non-trivial  and requires a good amount of experience, intuitition, and understanding of the numerical methods.


##### Physics of the problem 
A further consideration lies in determining the level of fidelity of the physics in the CFD model. For example, all matter--including fluids in all phases--has a finite level of compressibility. The compressibility is defined by the bulk compressibility factor which is a ratio of the relative change in volume of the fluid per change in pressure: $k=1/V \frac{dV}{dp}$, this can be defined isothermally or isentropically.  But, if the relative change in volume (or the we can think of density) for the pressure change in a given fluid system, we can greatly simplify the Navier-Stokes equation by considering a constant density flow. 

:::tip[Rule of thumb]
As a genaral rule, if the local Mach number is below 0.3, the compressibility effects will be negligible. Keep in mind that for simulations of, for example atmospheric flows, where the pressure and temperature vary with elevation, or in flows with large temperature variations, where the density changes with temperature, the Mach number-based delination is not effective. In these case, we can solve incompressible equations with variable density fluid.

For compressible and non-isothermal flows, we must typically solve the conservation of energy equation which requires an additional state equation to relate the thermodynamic variables.  By default, most CFD solvers assume a calorically perfect gas, which imposes constant specific heat and ideal gas law. For simulations that have non-ideal thermodynamics, for example using the Peng-Robinson state equation, the solution of the thermodynamic solver requires an iterative loop and imposes significant computation overhead.  [Milan et al. (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999121004629) noted that the species transport equations and thermodynamics took over 56% of the total computational cost for a non-ideal, combustion simulation.

Computational expense of a simulation can grow significantly by considering additional physics (multiphase flows, electro-fluid-dynamics) or by addition strong source terms (buoyancy, radiation, heat release).

#### Computational domain and final simulation time











### What are the considerations for the simulation parameters?





### What parameters space do I need to cover?




## What do I need to resolve?







## EXAMPLE: Planning the simulation
We seek to simulate the flow the flow around an NACA4412 airfoil with a flap. 





**Scientific question**:
Seek to understand the buffeting frequency in between the airfoil/flap gap.


We must balance the need for accurate 

Is the flow over the airfoil critical to answer ? Can we simplify this problem to a simple representative problem? If yes, what are the potential limitations of the analysis?


Is 3 dimensional critical?

Is compressibility important? Is there a need for multiphysics computations (e.g. icing)? 

1. Select problem
2. Determine the desired level of abstraction
