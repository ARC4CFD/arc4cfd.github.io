:::note[Learning Objectives]
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
1. Construct a mesh and send to HPC
2. Configure numerical setup with HPC consideration
3. Understand interconnectivity among CFD tools
:::



This pre-processing step is common to the classical CFD workflow (sans HPC) and is presented here out of completness.



## Generate geometry



## Generate mesh

Discussion reconstructParMesh for openFoam




## Configure numerical setup
