:::note[Learning Objectives]
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
1. Construct a mesh and send to HPC
2. Configure numerical setup with HPC consideration
3. Understand interconnectivity among CFD tools
:::



This pre-processing step is common to the classical CFD workflow (sans HPC) and is presented here out of completness.



## Generate geometry



## Generate mesh

Discussion reconstructParMesh for openFoam




## Configure numerical setup



## Example: Grid generation

Mesh for the domain is generated using gmsh. 3 sets of mesh corresponding to varying y+ values are generated for the simulation. The boundary layer is modeled using SA turbulence model and the first cell y+ value in the models are constrained within 5. Table 1 gives the list of mesh and time step parameters considered for each y+ cases. Meshed domains are shown in Figs. 2-4. 





## Example: Simulation setup
Standard SA model is used for near-wall turbulence modeling while Smagorinsky LES sub-grid scale (SGS) model is implemented at wall-normal distances larger than a value specified from default wall-distance coefficient. (Refer to Molina et al (2017) for SU2 formulations). 
In SU2, 2nd order dual-time stepping scheme is used for time marching method with 5 inner iterations per time step. Total simulation duration is 400ms which corresponds to roughly 10 flow passes across stream wise direction. Results are saved every 2ms.
