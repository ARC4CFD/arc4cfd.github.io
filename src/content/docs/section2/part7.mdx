:::note[Learning Objectives]
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
1. Organize and plan result files on the cluster
2. Perform common 'a posteriori' analysis technique in CFD
3. Visualize flow field using various methods

## Postprocessing CFD simulations on HPC: Overview
![HPCcompromise.](../../../assets/figs_section2/ARC4CFD_workflow_POSTPROC.png "Process simulations of the CFD simulation")

## Organize and plan result files on the cluster
Explain how to organize result files on the cluster. Join MPI files. [TO DO]

## Common 'a posteriori' analysis techniques in CFD (JPH: please focus on the HPC aspects, not the turbulence aspects)
Explain the most important type of 'a posteriori' analysis [TO DO]. 
1. Long time average
2. Phase average
3. First order statistics
4. Second order statistics



## Visualization
Explain common ways of visualizing the flow: [TO DO]
1. Download data on local machine.
3. Use VDI nodes for flow visualization.
2. [parallel/remote  visualization](https://docs.scinet.utoronto.ca/index.php/Visualization) 

## Data transfer
