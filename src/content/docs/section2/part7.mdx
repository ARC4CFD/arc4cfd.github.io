## Postprocessing CFD simulations on HPC: Overview
![HPCcompromise.](../../../assets/figs_section2/ARC4CFD_workflow_POSTPROC.png "Process simulations of the CFD simulation")

After completing [section 2.6](https://arc4cfd.github.io/section2/part6/), our large-scale CFD simulation is now running on the HPC system, and printing results as specified by the user. We also learned how to monitor the simulation using simple line commands on terminal, and the very useful plotting tool [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/). At this point **the fun part** begins as we can dive into the visualization of the results.


## Organize and plan result files on the cluster
Explain how to organize result files on the cluster. Join MPI files. [TO DO]

## Common 'a posteriori' analysis techniques in CFD (JPH: please focus on the HPC aspects, not the turbulence aspects)
Explain the most important type of 'a posteriori' analysis [TO DO]. 
1. Instantaneous flow.
2. Long time average
3. Phase average
4. First order statistics
5. Second order statistics

## Visualization
Explain common ways of visualizing the flow: [TO DO]
1. Download data on local machine.
3. Use VDI nodes for flow visualization.
2. [parallel/remote  visualization](https://docs.scinet.utoronto.ca/index.php/Visualization)

## Grid convergence and code validation 
Explain the importance of a grid sensitivity study and how to carry it out [TO DO]

## Data transfer
