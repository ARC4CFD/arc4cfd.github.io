## Organize and plan result files on the cluster
Explain how to organize result files on the cluster. Join MPI files. [TO DO]

## Common 'a posteriori' analysis techniques in CFD
Explain the most important type of 'a posteriori' analysis [TO DO]
1. Long time average
2. Phase average
3. First order statistics
4. Second order statistics

## Visualization
Explain common ways of visualizing the flow: [TO DO]
1. Download data on local machine.
3. Use VDI nodes for flow visualization.

## Data transfer
