By the end of this section, you should be able to:
1. Organize and plan simulation files on the cluster
2. Run the simulation and optimize
3. Carry out a runtime analysis of flow parameters

## Organize simulation files on the cluster
Explain how to move files on the cluster and set up the run [TO DO] 

## Run simulation using a batch script file
Explain various ways of running the BFS simulation [TO DO]
1. Interactive nodes
2. Batch 
3. Importance of automation

## Perform a runtime analysis of flow parameters
Explain how to perform runtime analysis to check if steady-state is reached [TO DO].  


## Perform a grid convergence study 
Explain the importance of a grid sensitivity study and how to carry it out [TO DO]

## SUGGESTION JPH: discuss I/O issues (binary vs ASCII, parallel output (e.g. OF) vs serial output (or parallel output + merge as done in SU2))

## SUGGESTION JPH: Brief discussion on V\& V 
How can we validate and verify in the context of HPC. validate and verify on smaller problems, gain confidence and verify large scale test (avoid iterating as it's very expensive in HPC costs)
