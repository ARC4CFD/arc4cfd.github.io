:::note[Learning Objectives]
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
1. Run a comprehensive scaling analysis on your problem
2. Understand the compiling and profiling strategies to optimize HPC
3. Determine parameters that modify the balancing of computational loads among workers
4. Optimize CFD simulations on HPC system

In the previous section, we developed a systematic approach to construct a CFD problem that aligns with the underlying scientific question that we seek to answer, conducted an a priori estimate of the computational expense, and pre-processed the simulation. 

Given a mesh, setup, and operating conditions, the objective of this section is to efficiently utilize the available HPC ressources.





For a given CFD simulation, how can we determine the best system to use?

## Why is scaling important? 
We seek to best utilize the computational architechture for our CFD problem. The
