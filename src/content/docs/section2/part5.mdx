## Optimizing CFD simulations for HPC: Overview
In the previous classes, we planned the simulations, estimated the HPC costs, and pre-processed the files for the simulation. Now, we will turn our attention to optimizing the usage of HPC resources. In this section, for a given CFD simulation and code, the objective is to most efficiently utilize the available HPC ressources. We will assume an end-user approach to the CFD code usage, therefore we won't cover topics that would force us to look into code.

## Assessing scalability of the code
To optimally utilize HPC ressources, the CFD solver must be parallilezable and scalable. That is to say, by increasing the number of compute cores, we reduce the overall wall clock time for a given problem. This speed-up is achieve if each processor is able to complete computational tasks independently from the other. To quantify the parallel performance of a CFD problem on a CFD code, we will define two types of scaling: **strong scaling** and **weak scaling**. Each are presented in this section.


### Strong scaling
Strong scaling, also refered to as Amdahl's law, quantifies the expected speedup with increasing number of computational processors  for a **fixed-sized computational task**. For a fixed task, such as a CFD simulation, increasing the number of parallel processes results in a decrease in the workload per processor, thus, should lead to a reduction in wall clock time. Eventually, as the number of processors increase and the per-processor workload shrinks, the communication overhead between the processors  will impact the strong scaling. The strong scaling is particularly useful for compute-bound processes (CPU-bound), which are typical of most CFD software.

 Many tasks can be divided among processors to reduce the overall computational cost of the simulations, yet some task, let's call them 'housekeeping' tasks, cannot be effectively parallelized.  In CFD codes, 'housekeeping' task may be tied to reading input files or allocating variables, which usually is most important in the initialization of the simulation. For most large scale simulations, these poorly parallelizeable tasks represent only a minimal amount of the total computational cost (it's usually limited to the initialization).  Let's assume a CFD simulation is parallizeable with minimal serial housekeeping tasks the speedup can be compute as the ratio of the time it takes (in seconds) a specific task on 1 processor ($t(1)$) to time of the same task on $n$ processors ($t(n)$):
$$
    S_n=\frac{T(1)}{T(n)}
$$
Ideal parallelizability would imply that doubling the number of processors would halve the computational wall time, or: $T_1= n T_n$. This would correspond to 100\% parallel efficiency of the code, where the parallel efficiency is defined as:
$$
    \eta = \frac{n T(1)}{T(n)}
$$

Although theoretically possible, superlinear speed up is usually rarely observed in CFD simulations, especially as

###  Weak scaling
Weak scaling defines the computational efficiency of a **scaled problem size**  with number of processors. Weak scaling evaluates a constant per processor workload, thus provides an estimate of the size of the computational task on a larger HPC system for the same wall clock time. Weak scaling is often refered to as Gustafson's law and is a perticularly useful to evaluate memory-limited applications; embarassingly parrellel problems tend to have near perfect weak scaling capabilities.  As weak scaling involves increasing the computational tasks with this number of processors, this implies scaling the number of grid points with the number of processors, thus represents a more involved scaling test compared to strong scaling.

For a problem size of $M$ computed on $N$ processors, the time to complete a task is $t(M,N)$. With these definitions, we can define the weak scaling speedup as:
$$
    \text{weak speedup} =\frac{t(M,1)}{t(N\times M,N)} 
$$
It's clear that the size of the computational task on the denomintor ($N\times M$) increases with the number processors, thus maintaining a constant workload on each processor. As the number of processes increase, the communication overhead increases, reducting the weak scaling speedup. For geometrically complex problems, weak scaling is challenging as it requires a new mesh for each number of processors. For a 2D structured mesh, we can, for example, define $M=64^2$ to be run on 1 processor. On four processors, each processor would run  $M=64^2$ but the total CFD problem would be  $4\times M= 128^2$; on 16 processors, each processor still $M=64^2$ but the total problem size is $16\times M= 256^2$, and so on.

### Scaling tests for CFD
The scaling tests are an **essential** component to running large scale simulations on HPC systems. It's important that the scaling test will naturally depend on the CFD code but also, very importantly, will depend on the simulation. For example, if you use a dynamic inflow boundary condition (injection of turbulence at the inlet), the local overhead in computing the inflow variable may result in a slowdown due to the processor waiting 

. As a result, a same CFD code with different operating conditions may show different scaling properties and may require load balancing.

A code performance is also dependent on the architecture of the HPC systeme, therefore


```bash
[username@nia0144 ~]$ /bin/time SU2_CFD MyInput.cfg
```

1. Use wall clock times or any equivalent metric to compute the time
2. Define a consist metric to evaluate time (e.g. time to run 100 time steps). Avoid defining times that are not consistent or dependent on the simulation (e.g. 1s of simulation time)
3. Select the metric such that you minimize the importance of the serial housekeeping tasks: for example if you only compute 5 time steps, yet the initialization takes up about 25\% of the total 
4. Scaling is solver and hardware specific. A scaling test on different architecture will give different results.
5. Use a simulation that is most representative of the actual run you plan on conducting.
6. Ideally, run multiple independent runs per job size and average the results.






To be valuable, the scaling test should be conducted on a the same system and similar problem

## Assessing the optimal HPC system for a given code
The roofline model is a simple representation of arithmetic intensity  versus performance of a code, and helps to asses the theoretical limits based on the systems architecture and memory characteristics. There are two limiting factors to the performance of a code, namely limitations on the:
1.  CPU peak performance (compute-bound)
2. RAM memory bandwidth (memory-bound)

The roofline 

The roofline model can be mathematically defined as:
$$
    P_{max}=\min(P_{peak},I*b_{max})
$$
where $P_{peak}$ is the hardware peak performance (FLOPS) and  is the peak bandwidth $b_{max}$. The $I$ is the algortihmic intensity and is code dependent. Most CFD codes have a high algorithmic intensity, for this reason, they are most of the time, compute-bound. Optimally, we would select a system which falls at the ridge point where the memory and computational limits intersect.

## Achieving  load balance parallel computations
For the optimal use of HPC ressources, the parallelized tasks should be equally spread out among all processors. Imbalances in the workload, can inneficiencies that result in some processors waiting for others to finish. The load imbalance may be particularly accute in CFD as HPC systems are increasingly heterogeneous and dynamic workload (through, for example, adaptive mesh refinement)

### Communication among processors
Most modern CFD codes primarily use multiple MPI processes on different physical CPU cores which are connected. As seen earlier, the inter-processor communication is often the bottleneck which limits the interprocessor communication.

In CFD computations, communication is necessary to compute the flux accross physical MPI processes as well as averaging other operations that require information exchange (e.g. fast fourier transforms). The deecomposition of the CFD domain among the various processors is not unique and can impact the communication, and thus scalability of the code. In the illustrative example shown in Figure (ref fig:sec2_Parallelization), an $N\times M$ CFD domain is decomposed either in four blocks of either $N\times M/4$ or  $N/2\times M/2$ on two dual core processors. As the communication between cores has typically more latency than among two processors on the same chip. The overall communication will be more efficient with the $N\times M/4$ decomposition. It is easy comprehend how this communication problem is exacerbated when discussing high number of cores for a 3D problem.
