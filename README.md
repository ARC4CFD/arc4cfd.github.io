This open-source, asynchronous course on the effective utilization of Advanced Reseach Computing (ARC) resources for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This course fills the knowledge gap between a university-level CFD course and the utilization of these CFD tools on modern computing architectures. It's a 16 hour course that built around concrete examples using open-source CFD tools.


## Target audience
This course is aimed at the following audience:

* Graduate students  or researchers entering the field of ARC for CFD
* Experimental researchers that want to leverage CFD simulations
* Undergraduates on students design team
* Industry-based researchers that want to use ARC for CFD

The course is intended to cover the basic concepts in high-performance computing (HPC) while providing a hands-on, practical training. Given the wide scope, this course is designed to be comprehensive summary of the field.


## Pre-requisites
The pre-requisites for the course are:
* University-level knowledge in fluid dynamics
* Introductory university-level CFD course
* Familiarity with navigating terminal and bash commands

The students that do not have the pre-requisite knowledge can consult the Resources page for additional content to supplement their knowledge.
