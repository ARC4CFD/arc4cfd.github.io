# ARC4CFD 
This open-source, asynchronous course on the effective utilization of Advanced Research Computing (ARC) resources for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This course fills the knowledge gap between a university-level CFD course and the utilization of these CFD tools on modern computing architectures. It's a 16 hour online course that built around concrete examples using open-source CFD tools. To access the course,  please visit [https://arc4cfd.github.io](https://arc4cfd.github.io).

## Supplementary Material
The numerical examples used in this course can be downloaded from [https://github.com/ARC4CFD/arc4cfd](https://github.com/ARC4CFD/arc4cfd)


## Pre-requisites
The pre-requisites for the course are:
* University-level knowledge in fluid dynamics
* Introductory university-level CFD course
* Familiarity with navigating terminal and bash commands

The students that do not have the pre-requisite knowledge can consult the Resources page for additional content to supplement their knowledge.


## Authors
This course was developed in the [Multi-Physics Interaction Lab](https://www.mpilab.ca)  at the University of Waterloo, Canada by Dr. Jean-Pierre Hickey and Dr. Francesco Ambrogi. A list of contributors to the course can be found in [AUTHORS](AUTHORS).
